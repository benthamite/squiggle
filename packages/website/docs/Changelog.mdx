## 0.7.0

### @quri/squiggle-lang

Language:

- New functions: `List.concat`, `List.uniq`, `List.append`, `List.flatten`, `List.join`, `Dict.mapKeys`.
- `stdev` and `variance` work for all kinds of distributions.
- Support for `==`, `!=` and `+` on strings.
- Support for trailing comma in arrays: `arr = [5,6,]` is now allowed.
- `Plot.fn` allows for programmatical control of `min..max` range in charts.
- Support for `{ p10: ..., p90: ... }` and `{ p25: ..., p75: ... }` in `normal()` and `lognormal()`.
- Non-integer key lookups in arrays are now disallowed; `arr[1.5]` and `arr[3/0]` will result in error; previously non-integer keys got rounded to 0 or the closest integer.
- Fix for zero parameter function quirks; the checks are now stricter and some existing code might break.
- Fix for `normal(5,2) * 0` special case.
- Fix for summary stats and `inv` function on `pointMass` distributions.
- Fix for `inv` and `sample` on discrete distributions.

JS API:

- `sq` function allows to embed Squiggle code in JS with syntax highlighting in VS Code (when VS Code extension is installed).
- `value.asJS()` method for easier conversion of results to JS values.

Other:

- ES6 modules build (we still provide CommonJS build as well).

### @quri/squiggle-components

UI:

- New code editor based on Codemirror, with the improved syntax highlighting and auto-completion for variables and stdlib functions.
- Charts are now implemented in pure Canvas with D3 (instead of Vega), with some improvements in UI and rendering speed.

Other:

- This package is now ESM-only! We depend on D3, and D3 is ESM-only, so squiggle-components has to be ESM-only as well. If your project still uses CommonJS and you doesn't use Next.js or other smart transpiler, you might encounter problems. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) for advice.
- Much smaller bundle size, thanks to removing some heavy dependencies.
- `oneLine` prop in `SquiggleEditor` removed (probably no one used it).

## 0.6.0

- Language reimplemented in Typescript instead of Rescript.
- 2x performance boost on average on typical Squiggle code. Most improvements come from optimizations in distribution operations.
- Color fixes and improved distribution charts in components.
- `mean()` on mixed pointsets now works correctly.

## 0.5.1

- Error locations and stacktraces.
- New functions: `List.length`, `Dist.set` and `Dist.map`.
- Improved `to` precedence order.
- Improvements to `->` operator: more stuff can be passed on the right side, e.g. anonymous functions.
- Support for empty records (`{}`).
- Various performance improvements; overall speedup on real code is around 5%.

## 0.5.0

- Performance improvements:
  - Interpreter is now 5x-20x faster on code written in Squiggle
  - SampleSet to PointSet conversions are 2x faster
  - cdf function on SampleSets is 30x faster
  - overall speedup is about 2x on average on real code written in Squiggle
- 50% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang); 20% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components).

### Breaking changes

Some rarely used math functions got removed or moved to the `Math` namespace.

For example, `cos(x)` is now `Math.cos(x)`, and `atanh(x)` doesn't exist.

If your code is now failing with `<function> is not defined` for anything from [this list](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html), try adding `Math.` prefix first, and then complain on [Github issues](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues).
