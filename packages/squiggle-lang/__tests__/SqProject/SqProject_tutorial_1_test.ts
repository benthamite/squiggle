       First you need to create a project. A project is a collection of sources. 
       Project takes care of the dependencies between the sources, correct compilation and run order. 
       You can run any source in the project. It will be compiled and run if it hasn't happened already; otherwise already existing results will be presented.
       The dependencies will be automatically compiled and run. So you don't need to worry about that in a multi source project.
       In summary you issue a run command on the whole project or on a specific source to ensure that there is a result for that source.

       You will look at the results of this source and you don't want to run the others if not required.
